# ALTTP MENU TRACKER

_developed by asazas_

## Description

Simple, web-based tracker for _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Randomizer_ designed to resemble the in-game menu. Inspired by the [item tracker](https://github.com/crossproduct42/alttprandohelper) developed by [crossproduct](https://www.twitch.tv/crossproduct). Unlike said tracker, this one does not implement any logic or map trackers.

## Usage

Toggle items on and off by clicking on them. That's about it. For items with multiple upgrades, or two items that take up the same spot in the tracker, clicking on them several times will cycle through all possible states. For dungeons, clicking the name will cycle through prizes (pendants or crystals).

## Disclaimer

I am aware that this is a coding mess. The zoom feature does not work well and performance most likely depends on web browser and/or screen resolution. Nevertheless, you are free to use this tracker as you see fit, as well as to develop and distribute modifications of it.
